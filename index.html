                            <p>Phase I is carried out with up to 5 of the original 10,000 substances.  It has been shown that over 99% of the original substances are not suitable for further development.</p>
                            <p>Phase I clinical studies are the first step in testing a new clinical drug in humans. In these studies, researchers evaluate what dose of the drug is safe, how a new drug should be administered (e.g. orally or by injection) and how frequently (e.g. three times a day). The researchers watch very closely for any side-effects that the volunteer may experience.</p>
                            <p>For some target diseases, it is unethical to conduct Phase I studies in healthy volunteers, due to the toxic side-effects of the Candidate, such as clinical drugs developed to treat HIV and Cancer. Therefore, Phase I studies in these clinical drugs will be carried out in patients who have the target disease.</p>
                            <p>During a clinical study, blood samples, clinical drug excretion characteristics, together with positive and negative effects of the drug are all monitored. This information is used to establish how the clinical drug behaves in the human body. An early signal of the clinical drug activity in humans may be seen.</p>

                            <p>Phase II is carried out using 3 of the original 10,000 substances.</p>
                            <p>Phase II clinical studies assess the safety and efficacy of a clinical drug, and evaluate how it affects the human body. This usually focuses on a particular target disease (medical condition).</p>
                            <p>In phase II clinical studies, the drug is given to a small number of people with the target disease, so that the therapeutic efficacy of the drug can be observed. The data from these patient studies is compared to data from the Phase I clinical studies involving healthy participants, and any variations in behaviour of the clinical drug when the target disease is present, are noted.</p>
                            <p>The re-evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and excretion data will often result in an optimal dosage of the clinical drug being established.</p>
                            <p>There is also a so called 'Point of Transition' period. At the end of this period the uncertainties around the project have been sufficiently reduced by data from studies such as those conducted by Chemistry Manufacturing and Control, pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, and it is scientifically justified for the company to further invest in further Phase II if necessary and then Phase III studies in a larger population of patients.</p>

                            <p>As well as studying the safety and efficacy of the new clinical drug, comparisons are often also made with placebo and alternative treatments during Phase III clinical studies, in order to demonstrate an improved risk:benefit ratio.</p>
                            <p>In addition, Phase III clinical studies may also be carried out to assess the effects of the clinical drug on (for example) young and old patients, different stages of the target disease if relevant, or in combination with other drugs so that safe dosage levels can be established in these groups.</p>
                            <p>This is the busiest and most intensive phase of any clinical studies programme. The analysis of the data from the studies will form the decision point for an application for the Product License and Marketing Authorization.</p>

                        	<p>APPROVAL - APPLICATION FOR PRODUCT LICENSE<br/><br/>Application for approval with one substance.<br/><br/>The data from the Phase I through to Phase III clinical studies are evaluated and reports are produced.<br/><br/>These reports, also including the data from the pre-clinical studies, are then submitted to the Regulatory Authorities for evaluation by a team of experts.<br/><br/>The data will need to be submitted to the Regulatory Authority in each country within which the Company wants to market the new clinical drug.<br/><br/>If a new clinical drug is considered to be effective and safe, a Product License will be granted to the Company to allow them to market the clinical drug.</p><br/>
                            <p>POST-MARKETING - POST-MARKETING STUDIES (PHASE IV)<br/><br/>Once a Company has been granted a Product License, further research into the clinical drug is still required. Phase IV clinical studies are usually undertaken in close collaboration with the Company's marketing department. The aim is usually to evaluate further the safety and efficacy of the new drug in much larger numbers of people, and under "real life" conditions.<br/><br/>Another reason for performing further clinical studies is to explore and extend the range of target diseases for which the drug may be used. Also, further knowledge is gained about aspects of the drug such as epidemiological data, pharmaco-epidemiological information, and Health-Economics and outcomes data.<br/><br/>If any additional target diseases are identified for which the new clinical drug may be used to treat, appropriate clinical studies are required first, in order to update and obtain approval for the new Product License.</p>
